The **Campus Course Records Manager (CCRM)** is a console-based Java application designed to manage student records, course enrollments, grading, and transcript generation. Built using core Java SE features, it demonstrates object-oriented programming, file handling with NIO.2, Java Streams, the DateTime API, custom exceptions, and design patterns. The application supports import/export and backup functionalities, making it a comprehensive tool for academic data management. CCRM runs on Java 11 or higher and can be compiled and executed from the command line or set up in an IDE like Eclipse for easier development and testing. It serves as a practical demonstration of how Java can be used to build real-world applications, especially in the education domain. The modular structure of the CCRM project promotes clean code architecture and maintainability, while the console-based interface ensures simplicity and cross-platform compatibility. Users can navigate through various menu options to perform tasks such as adding students, enrolling them in courses, assigning grades, and generating transcripts. The use of assertions, custom exceptions, and Java's robust file I/O capabilities ensures data integrity and error handling. Additionally, the project is a good example for students or developers learning Java, as it incorporates several modern language features introduced in Java 8 and beyond, such as lambda expressions and the Stream API, along with a clear demonstration of Java SE's evolution and ecosystem setup.
